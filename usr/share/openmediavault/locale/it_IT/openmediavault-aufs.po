"Aufs sets either 'fsnotify' or 'inotify' to all the accessed directories on "

"consumes resources, cpu and memory. Performance will be hurt, but it is most"

"before, the cached data about the file will be discarded and aufs will re-"
"lookup it."

"Aufs tests only the existence of the file which existed. If the existed file"

msgid ""
"UDBA means a modification to a branch filesystem manually or directly, e.g. "
"bypassing aufs. While aufs is designed and implemented to be safe after "
"UDBA, it can make yourself and your aufs confused. And some information like"
" aufs inode will be incorrect. For example, if you rename a file on a branch"
" directly, the file on aufs may or may not be accessible through both of old"
" and new name. Because aufs caches various information about the files on "
"branches. And the cache still remains after UDBA. Aufs has a mount option "
"named 'udba' which specifies the test level at access time whether UDBA was "
"happened or not."
